Written in javascript, this project is meant to replicate instant messenger websites.
Using Node.js as well as websockets, I was able to successfully create the messenger,
with a good deal of learnings in the process.

My understandings of api's and servers had been shaky up to this point, but working on
this project and being forced to struggle through the various new concepts has been a
blessing in disguise. I have managed to put my learnings during this project into great
effect in the professional work I have done, but I am quite curious to investigate how
other languages would handle similar processes.

All around, I found this project arguably the most difficult but ultimately the most
practically educational of those I have completed.
